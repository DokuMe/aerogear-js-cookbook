**Problem**


**Solution**


**Working Code Example**

To run the example code, first run:

    $ npm install && bower install

This will pull down the dependent javascript/css files, such as jquery, into the project.

This will also install the server component.

To run the demo:

    $ npm start

This will start a small express.js server that hosts the app and it's REST endpoints.

Point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to test it out
